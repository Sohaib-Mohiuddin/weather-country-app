# üåç Weather CLI App

## Overview
The **Weather CLI App** is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) application that retrieves real-time and historical weather data for any city worldwide. It integrates the **RESTCOUNTRIES API** to fetch country and city details and the **OpenWeatherMap API** and **Open-Meteo API** to provide current and past weather conditions. The app is designed to offer a seamless user experience with features like autocompletion, rich text formatting, and progress indicators.

### Why This Project?
This project was developed to:
- Provide an easy-to-use CLI for fetching weather data.
- Explore API integrations and CLI user experience enhancements.
- Utilize real-time and historical weather data for informative insights.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed.
- Set up the required OpenWeatherMap API key in a `.env` file:
  ```sh
  OWM_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
  ```

### **Running the Application**
To start the Weather CLI App, run:
```sh
./run-script.sh
```

## Features
- **Country & City Autocomplete** ‚Äì Makes input easier.
- **Current Weather Data** ‚Äì Fetches real-time weather.
- **Historical Weather Data** ‚Äì Retrieves the same day's past weather.
- **Enhanced CLI UI** ‚Äì Uses `rich` and `colorama` for stylish output.
- **Progress Indicators** ‚Äì Shows API fetching status.

---

## Challenges Faced
1. **Handling API Rate Limits:** Ensured requests were efficiently managed to avoid restrictions.
2. **Historical Weather Data Accuracy:** Open-Meteo provided a 7-day range, which needed filtering to get only the required date.
3. **Formatting CLI Output:** Improved readability using `rich` tables and styles.

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- **Multi-language support** for wider accessibility.
- **Graphical Data Visualization** of temperature trends.
- **Offline Mode** ‚Äì Caching recent weather data for quick access.
- **Hourly Weather Forecasts** for the next 7 days.
